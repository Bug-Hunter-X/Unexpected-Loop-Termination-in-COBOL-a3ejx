# Unexpected Loop Termination in COBOL

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in COBOL programs involving unexpected loop termination. The program intends to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10, but due to the nature of COBOL's PERFORM statement and potential interference, the loop might terminate prematurely.  The solution shows an improved, safer approach.
